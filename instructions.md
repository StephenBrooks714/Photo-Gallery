### **Project Title:**

Photo Gallery

### **Project Description:**

The Photo Gallery project is designed to help students practice and demonstrate their knowledge of CSS Units, Float, Overflow, Background Image, and Shadows. Students will create a web page that displays a photo gallery with images, captions, and navigation controls.

### **Project Objectives:**

1. HTML Structure: Create an HTML document with a gallery section containing multiple images and captions.
2. CSS Units: Use CSS units such as pixels (px) and percentages (%) for defining element sizes and layout.
3. Float: Apply the float property to align images side by side within the gallery.
4. Overflow: Utilize the overflow property to handle content that overflows the gallery container.
5. Background Image: Set a background image for the gallery container to enhance the visual appearance.
6. Shadows: Add box shadows to images for a three-dimensional effect when hovered over.
7. Navigation: Include navigation controls (next and previous buttons) for users to browse through the gallery.
8. Caption Styling: Style image captions with appropriate fonts, colors, and positioning.
9. Documentation: Provide comments in the HTML and CSS code to explain key sections and styles.
